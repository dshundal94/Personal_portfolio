        <h2>Aspiring Data Scientist, Berkeley Physics Graduate</h2>
        <h3 id = "about">ABOUT</h3>
      <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities to develop my technical skills in the fields
  of Data Science and Big Data, as well as obtaining business and
  entrepreneurial experience. After graduating from Berkeley, I decided that I wanted to dive into the field of Data Science to make people's life marginally simpler. The way I would do this is by leveraging data to drive business decisions. These business decisons would allow the company to work more efficiently creating a better product for the people. By using a more efficient and superior product, people's lives would be much simpler compared to if business decisions were not driven by data.</p>
      <p>During my last semester at Berkeley, I studied for my Real Estate License in California. After obtaining my real estate license, I decided that I could use data from the metrolist to predict selling prices of home in the area I was working (San Joaquin Area). After using machine learning algorithms to predict selling prices for homes, I used the program to help clients decide what price should they bid their offer when purchasing homes. Obtaining that insight from data gave my clients more confidence in what price they should offer. Less stress for the clients is always a bonus.</p>
      <p>To further my knowledge and experience in the field of data science, I've taken over 7 courses on Coursera ranging from Big Data with Hadoop Technologies to Machine Learning. I'v done natural language processing, built recommender systems, created spam filters, and used machine learning to forecast trends with time series. I've also started working towards my Full Stack Certification from freeCodeCamp. I've worked extensively with Python, MATLAB, and SQL, along with having experience with Hadoop and Spark.</p>
      <p>So, if you know anyone or any company that is need of a data scientist that has a deep understanding of data analysis, feature creation, model training and testing, please contact me for more information of what how I can provide value. </p>

    <p id = "information">The image on the left links to my project that predicts selling prices of homes in the San Joaquin Area. I used the Jupyter Notebook environment to do the modeling of the data. I used excel and the pivot tables to find and correct data that was inputted incorrectly. I used pandas to read the data and manipulate features to set up for my machine learning algorithms. I predicted the data using decision trees, random forest, neural networks, and different boosting algorithms. I found that XGBoost worked well in predicting the final selling prices of homes. To look further into my finding please click the image on the left.</p>
      <p>The image on the right links to my project that used visualizations to view different market trends that are occuring in the San Joaquin area. I used pandas again to read the files, and matplotlib to visualize the data. I also forecasted the trends by using ARIMA. This was a time series analyses and filtering was done to deal with seasonality and other trends. To learn more about this project please click on the image to the right.</p>
